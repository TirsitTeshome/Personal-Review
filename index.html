                    <h1>If I could give “Born a Crime” a new title, it would be “ From the Black, White and Beyond:
                        Navigating a
                        Divided World.”</h1>
                </div>

                <p>
                    While the existing title is undeniably impactful in drawing attention to the illegality of his
                    birth,
                    “From
                    the Black, White and Beyond: navigating a divided world” better describes the reality of race in
                    shaping
                    Trevor’s early life. The phrases “black” and “white” literally evoke the racial classifications of
                    apartheid. Metaphorically, “black and white” refers to the good and the bad, representing Trevor’s
                    experience of both sides of the world. However “and beyond” is crucial because it speaks to his
                    mixed
                    race
                    identity.

                    <p>The quote is a strange and a very sad thought about how some people perceive most relationships.
                        It shows
                        how
                        they want to control someone, in the name of love. This quote highlights how easily people fall
                        into
                        social
                        aspects that value a woman that is “free and independent” until she has a husband. Then she has
                        to be
                        fully
                        controlled. We see this happening today in many ways.</p>

                    Think about a woman who has a good job, but everyone expects her to prioritize her husband's career
                    over her
                    own. Or a mom who stays home with her kids, but people judge her for not having her own career. It's
                    the
                    idea
                    that a woman should be primarily defined by her relationship and her home life, not for who she is
                    as a
                    person.
                </div>

                <div id="detail-2">
                    From my own experience, I have seen this play out with female family members who were initially
                    praised for
                    being ground breakers in their careers, only to face pressure to conform to traditional roles once
                    married.
                    Their individuality became a source of tension and conflict.

                    Abel’s desire for traditional marriage is not inherently wrong, the contradiction lies in wanting a
                    free-spirited partner only to then suppress that spirit. This quote serves as a reminder of the
                    importance
                    of recognizing and challenging these paradoxical expectations that limit both men and women, and
                    ultimately
                    poison relationships.
